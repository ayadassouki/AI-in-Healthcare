# Diabetes Patient Management Application

This project is a comprehensive diabetes management system that helps manage patient data, medication information, and patient classification for Type I and Type II diabetes. It was created as part of a hackathon and demonstrates a JavaFX application with data processing and visualization capabilities.

## Features
- **Patient Registration Screen**: Allows users to register new patients and store their information.
- **Results Display**: A feature to view processed data of diabetes medications and patient classification.
- **Diabetes Medications Data**: Detailed information on medications used for treating Type I/II diabetes, including possible allergies, age, and diet restrictions.
- **Data Processing Notebooks**: Provides analysis of patient data using Jupyter notebooks.

## Files and Structure
- **Java Application**: The core functionality is implemented in Java with the following files:
  - `App.java` & `App.class`
  - `PatientRegistrationScreen.java` & `PatientRegistrationScreen.class`
  - `Results.java` & `Results.class`
  
- **Data Files**:
  - `Medications for Type I_II diabetes - Sheet1.csv`: Medication data for Type I and Type II diabetes.
  - `patient_classification_processed.csv`: Processed classification data for patients.
  - `patient_medications.csv`: Data on patient medications.
  
- **Analysis**:
  - `diabetes.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for analyzing diabetes data and performing further analysis.

- **Media**:
  - `WhatsApp Video 2024-03-22 at 8.58.31 PM.mp4`: A video explaining the application workflow and features.
